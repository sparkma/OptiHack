There's a lot of interesting XHCI/EHCI related stuff in the BIOS that can be enabled/tweaked with a modified Grub shell. Here's some snippets.
---
This default is bad.

```
0x53D4C 		One Of: EHCI Hand-off, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName): 0x2, VarStore: 0x11, QuestionId: 0x308, Size: 1, Min: 0x0, Max 0x0, Step: 0x0 {05 A6 4B 07 4C 07 08 03 11 00 02 00 10 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00}
0x53D72 			One Of Option: Disabled, Value (8 bit): 0x0 (default) {09 0E 42 07 30 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00}
0x53D80 			One Of Option: Enabled, Value (8 bit): 0x1 {09 0E 41 07 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00}
0x53D8E 		End One Of {29 02}
```

This default is also bad, should be set to enabled.

```
0x482E2 		One Of: XHCI Mode, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName): 0x144, VarStore: 0x2, QuestionId: 0x85, Size: 1, Min: 0x0, Max 0x0, Step: 0x0 {05 A6 36 02 37 02 85 00 02 00 44 01 10 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00}
0x48308 			One Of Option: Smart Auto, Value (8 bit): 0x3 (default) {09 0E C1 03 30 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00}
0x48316 			One Of Option: Auto, Value (8 bit): 0x2 {09 0E C0 03 00 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00}

0x4834E 		End One Of {29 02}
```

Another bad default. EHCx ports should all be routed to XHC.

```
0x48460 		One Of: Route USB 2.0 pins to which HC?, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName): 0x15A, VarStore: 0x2, QuestionId: 0x8A, Size: 1, Min: 0x0, Max 0x0, Step: 0x0 {05 A6 5B 02 5C 02 8A 00 02 00 5A 01 10 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00}
0x48486 			One Of Option: Route Per-Pin, Value (8 bit): 0x0 {09 0E 73 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00}
0x48494 			One Of Option: Route all Pins to EHCI, Value (8 bit): 0x1 (default) {09 0E 74 02 30 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00}
0x484A2 			One Of Option: Route all Pins to XHCI, Value (8 bit): 0x2 {09 0E 75 02 00 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00}
0x484B0 		End One Of {29 02}
```

~~Disabling these two removes the need for the EHCx_OFF patch.~~ Without the patch I still had the machine wake up sometimes, relating to EHCx stuff. With the patch it doesn't happen. I haven't checked in a while so maybe the patch is no longer needed.
