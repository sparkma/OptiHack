# Toolbox
These are the apps I use and have used in my journey so far. Some more essential than the others but all must have's on my installs.
* [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) - Easy way to remove apps including all their crud. Be sure to enable the *SmartDelete* function
* [Cog](https://github.com/kode54/Cog) - A lovely minimalist music player that has been around for a very long time
* [IINA](https://github.com/iina/iina) - Very smooth and open source video player for macOS
* [CotEditor](https://github.com/coteditor/CotEditor) - Fast and free editor with lots of features, dark mode and syntax highlighting
* [EFI Agent](https://github.com/headkaze/EFI-Agent/) - Using the command line to mount EFI folders is very 2019
* [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool) - My EDC
* [Hex Fiend](https://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/) - We all need a hex editor in our life. This is made by someone named Ridiculous Fish. How can you say no to that? On top of that its very fast, capable and totally free
* [HWMonitor](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-fakesmc-kozlek/downloads/) - Hidden inside the FakeSMC zip file we find an old dog with tricks you still want to see from time to time
* [Intel Power Gadget](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget/) - More accurate cpu/gpu/pwr stats
* [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) - Make remapping keys and buttons a breeze
* [MaciASL](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL) - Dark mode enabled MaciASL? Yes please!
* [Meld](https://github.com/yousseb/meld) - Compare (and merge) everything! Sweet little diff tool
* [Monolingual](https://ingmarstein.github.io/Monolingual/) - Remove unused languages and architectures from apps. Yes I like it tidy!
* [Onyx](https://titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html) - Always seem to come in handy at some point or another
* [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) - OpenCore config editor and very useful for other plist editing too
* [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) - To download those Linux iso's
* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org) - Can play pretty much any media file

Then there's Homebrew and less known, but useful as you don't need the full Homebrew installed, Rudix. Not to forget MacPorts, which has some packages not found on the previous two.

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - The best known and most complete package manager for macOS
* [Rudix](https://rudix.org) - Less known, a lot less packages but they're all pre-compiled and don't require anything but the package themselves
* [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) - Mostly packages needed to build stuff from source like cctools, I like this one but they don't have a wide selection
